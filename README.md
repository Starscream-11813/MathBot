## Foreword:
The goal of this model is to translate an MWP statement to a valid math expression, which when evaluated, yields the solution to the problem.

## Introduction:
### Definition:
A Math Word Problem is a textual narrative that states a problem description and poses a question about one or more unknown quantities. These type of problems are generally found in math text-books of 1st to 3rd grade kids.

### Example:
**Problem:**
$\text{69 teddy bears are sold for 23 dollars each.}$
$\text{There are total 420 teddy bears in a store and the remaining teddy bears are sold for 17 dollars each.}$
$\text{How much did the store earn after selling all the teddy bears?}$

**Expression:**
$x = 69Ã—23 + (420 âˆ’ 69)Ã—17$

Our approach is to use Transformer-based $\text{Seq2Seq}$ model to generate the mathematical expression from problem statement.

## Dataset:
The dataset we used is [MAWPS](https://aclanthology.org/N16-1136.pdf). There are 3,320 problems along with their solution expressions. Out of those, we took 2,373 problems that were specific to our interest, as the rest were geometry problems. After that we used a [question generator](https://github.com/RahulSharmaNITT/MathWordProblem) to generate similar problems. The final dataset had 38,144 problems in total. And our train-test split was $95-5$.

## Features:
Provide a simple Math Word Problem statement in the text-box on the left and click on the "Submit" button. After a few seconds, the model should yield a predicted math expression.
